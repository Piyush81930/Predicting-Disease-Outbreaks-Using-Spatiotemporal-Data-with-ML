# 🦠 Predicting Disease Outbreaks Using Spatiotemporal Data with Machine Learning

This project explores how **machine learning** and **spatiotemporal data** can be combined to forecast and visualize the spread of infectious diseases, using COVID-19 as a case study. The model integrates **climate data**, **mobility patterns**, and **socioeconomic indicators** to detect outbreak trends and issue early warnings.

### 📌 Objectives
- Predict disease outbreaks using ML algorithms based on spatiotemporal patterns  
- Support health authorities with real-time visualizations and alerts  
- Improve decision-making and resource allocation to prevent widespread infections

### 🧠 Methods Used
- ML Models: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression  
- DL Model: LSTM Neural Network for time-series analysis  
- SHAP for model explainability  
- Visual tools: Seaborn, Plotly, 3D geospatial mapping, Mapbox

### 📊 Key Features
- Real-time outbreak tracking with interactive global maps  
- Time-series geospatial visualizations to trace the spread  
- 3D spatial outbreak modeling for depth analysis  
- SHAP plots to understand model decisions  
- Region-wise outbreak distribution analysis

### 🗃️ Dataset & Preprocessing
- Features include: temperature, humidity, mobility, socioeconomic data, and health advisories  
- TF-IDF used for text processing  
- StandardScaler for normalization  
- One-hot encoding for categorical features

### ✅ Model Evaluation
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score  
- Visual validation using geospatial overlay  
- Confusion matrix and SHAP summary plots

### 🔍 Key Findings
- Rainfall, humidity, and mobility strongly affect disease spread  
- LSTM outperforms traditional classifiers for sequential data  
- Spatiotemporal ML significantly improves prediction accuracy over conventional models

### 🚀 Future Scope

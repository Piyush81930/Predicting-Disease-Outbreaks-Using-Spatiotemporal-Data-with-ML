Analyzes spatial and temporal trends

Visualizes spread with global geospatial maps

Helps in early detection and response planning

📁 Dataset
Includes historical outbreak data with timestamps and geolocations.

📊 Visualizations
Time-series geospatial maps

Global spread patterns

Outbreak intensity heatmaps

💡 Technologies Used
Python

Pandas & NumPy

Matplotlib & Seaborn

Geopandas / Folium

Scikit-learn

📌 Conclusion
This project demonstrates the potential of combining ML and spatial data for real-time disease monitoring and prediction.
